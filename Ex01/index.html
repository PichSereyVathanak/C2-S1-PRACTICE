        <h1>Welcome to CADTer student's Vlog</h1>
        <p><strong>My name is Khy Pichsereyvathanak,</strong> and I am currently a 2nd-year student at CADT, majoring in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science.</p>
        <p>Why CADT? <br>The reason I chose to study at CADT is that they offer more than other universities for the same major but with a different curriculum, including two internships for a Bachelor's degree.</p>
        <p>CADT always provides scholarships every year. For more information, you can check the schoolâ€™s website: <a href="https://www.cadt.edu.kh/">Cambodia Academy of Digital Technology (CADT) </a></p>

        <h2>Conclustion</h2>
        <p>Every university in Cambodia is unique and different from one another. Choose the university that aligns with your passion and field of interest. <br>Still curious about CADT? You can directly contact me via my email: <a href="mailto:vathana@gamil.com">vathanak@gmail.com</a></p>
